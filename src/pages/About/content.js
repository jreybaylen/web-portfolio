            JRey was one of our outsourced frontend developer in our team helping us accomplish our goals in our web app. 
            When we first hired JRey, I was a bit sceptical at first because of his age and experience as we wanted someone that is more experienced. But JRey proved himself in every aspect in his task, from shipping good code quality to production free bugs. 
            But what stood out the most is his desire to learn, and passion for what he does. 
            He's just very easy to work with, and would definitely recommend him.
